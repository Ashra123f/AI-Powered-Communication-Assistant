I built an AI-Powered Communication Assistant that automates the entire support email management process â€” from retrieval to response. The system fetches incoming emails, filters only the relevant support queries, and extracts key details such as sender, subject, body, and timestamp. Each email is then analyzed using NLP techniques for sentiment detection (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and priority classification (Urgent/Not Urgent) to ensure critical issues are addressed first.

A Large Language Model (LLM) is integrated to generate context-aware, empathetic draft replies, which can be reviewed and edited before sending. The assistant also performs information extraction, pulling out useful metadata like customer requirements or contact details to help support teams respond faster.

To make it user-friendly, I designed a clean Streamlit dashboard that displays:
Filtered support emails with extracted details
Analytics & stats: sentiment trends, priority distribution, email status (resolved/pending), and interactive visualizations
AI-generated draft responses for each email

Overall, this project improves efficiency, response quality, and customer satisfaction by reducing manual effort and intelligently automating repetitive communication tasks.
